    <h2>What is Data Carpentry?</h2>
    <p>
      Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data
      skills needed to conduct research. Our mission is to provide researchers
      high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of
      data-driven research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data Carpentry is now a lesson program within
      <a href="https://carpentries.org">The Carpentries</a>, having merged with
      <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> in January,
      2018. Data Carpentry's focus is on the introductory computational skills
      needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research.
      Our lessons are domain-specific, and build on the existing knowledge of
      learners to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own
      research. <i>Our initial target audience is learners who have
        little to no prior computational experience.</i> We create a friendly
      environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven
      discovery.
