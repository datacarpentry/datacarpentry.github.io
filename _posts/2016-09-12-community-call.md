Our next Carpentries Community Call (formerly called Lab Meeting or 
Town Hall meeting) will be Thursday, September 15 (September 16 Aus/NZ). These meetings will now be 
monthly on the third Thursday of every month. It would be great to 
see instructors there! These calls are a great chance to connect with 
other Carpentry instructors and get updates and information on 
important and interesting topics for the community. 

Times: 

* 7am Pacific / 10am Eastern / 2pm UTC / 12am (Sept 16th) Sydney
* 4pm Pacific / 7pm Eastern / 11pm UTC / 9am (Sept 16th) Sydney

Topics this month will include:

* New lesson template
* Policy committee and update on CoC
* IRB approval and updates on assessment 
* Highlighting manuscripts from our community
* Election on rules for Software Carpentry Steering Committee

Head over to the [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2016-09-15)
