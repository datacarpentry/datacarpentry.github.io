Twenty-five life science researchers from across the Netherlands
and Germany joined the event on March 22nd and 23rd in Science Park
Amsterdam. The workshop covered multiple aspects of working with
genomics data.

Lex Nederbragt from the University of Oslo, kicked off the event
with an introduction to the core dataset. The rest the first day
focused on working with R in RStudio environment to explore, clean
and visualise metadata in a tabular format, presented by Mateusz Kuzak
from the Netherlands eScience Center and has been wrapped up by Anita
Schurch from UMC Utrecht introducing the Unix shell and file system
navigation.

The following day Denis Schmitz and Sam Nooij from National Institute
for Public Health and the Environment continued the Unix shell lesson,
showing how to search, organize and document the project and how to
use for loops to do quality control of sequencing data.  Afterwards,
Lex dived deeper into shell automation, scripting and workflows.
Anita followed up with the ways to move data around between the cloud
and learners' laptops. At the end of this hands-on intensive day,
Natalie Danezi from SURFsara introduced High-Performance Computing
resources available to Dutch researchers.

During those two days, participants were not only presented with
various techniques of efficient data analysis but also had the
opportunity to learn how to use remote cloud resources provided by
SURFsara and Amazon. Instructors collaborated with SURFsara
consultants, Natalie Danezi, Ander Astudillo and Niek Bosch in the
preparation and documentation of the virtual machine running on
National HPC Cloud, based on the original Data Carpentry Amazon AMI.
This image and the documentation will be used in future workshops
organized within a partnership between ELIXIR and Software and Data
Carpentry Foundations.

The event closed with drinks and snacks at nearby Maslov Cafe.

We are just at the beginning of the journey. More work needs to be
done on improving genomics lesson, and Data Carpentry is looking
forward to contributions from everyone interested in providing help.
