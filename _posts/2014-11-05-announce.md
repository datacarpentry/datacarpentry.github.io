We are excited to announce that [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) has received a contribution from the [Moore
 Foundation](http://www.moore.org/) to support its activities and growth. Data Carpentry teaches researchers skills for working more
 effectively with data - skills that enable the paradigm of [data-driven
 discovery](http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery) being advanced by the Moore Foundation.  With the Moore
 Foundation's support, we will be able to help researchers in all domains accelerate their research.

[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), a sister project of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), was started
in 2014 with funding from the NSF (1), NSF BIO Centers (2) and [DataONE](http://dataone.org).  We develop curricula and run
workshops that are 1) domain specific; 2) target fundamental data analysis and data management challenges; and 3) require little or no
prior programming experience. We have already delivered several introductory workshops for biology that cover topics such as working
more effectively with spreadsheets, using SQL for data management, and analyzing data with R and command-line tools. The funding from
the Moore Foundation will enable us to run more of these workshops, develop lessons in more domains (including social science,
  genomics, and geosciences), train instructors, and engage the broader data science community.

To lead these efforts, Data Carpentry's board of directors has selected Dr. Tracy Teal of the [BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution
in Action](http://beacon-center.org) as its project lead. Tracy has already been working on this project through BEACON and will now be
able to devote herself to the project full-time. Tracy has a background in interdisciplinary data science, computational training, and
open and reproducible research. As an NSF postdoctoral fellow in biological informatics and then assistant professor at Michigan State
University, she has written open source bioinformatics tools and developed a research program in metagenomics and microbial ecology.
She has been a Software Carpentry instructor for more than three years and developed and taught numerous workshops in bioinformatics,
microbiology, and statistics. Aside from her role in Data Carpentry, she continues to be engaged in efforts on open and reproducible
research as a committee member of Workflows for Reproducible Research, the [International Network of Next-Generation
Ecologists](http://innge.net/) Open Science group and on the interim board of the Software Carpentry Foundation.

With the emergence of more data and larger datasets in all domains of research, we believe that knowing how to work effectively with
data can be a transformative experience for scientists. We are therefore very excited by the opportunity to grow Data Carpentry. You
can keep track of what we're up to through our [blog](http://datacarpentry.github.io/blog/), [website](http://datacarpentry.org), [email discuss list](http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/dc-discuss), [GitHub](https://github.com/datacarpentry) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/datacarpentry).  If
