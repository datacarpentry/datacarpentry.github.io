As a community-led organization, Data Carpentry depends on our active and highly-engaged volunteer community to carry out many of our core activities. Volunteer efforts span a wide range of activities, including teaching workshops, developing and maintaining lessons, and training and mentoring new instructors, among many other efforts. Without the commitment of our volunteers, Data Carpentry would never be able to reach such a broad learner base and to make such a huge impact on our learners.

We’d like to make it a habit to actively recognize and publicly acknowledge the great work that is being done by members of our community. Because there are so many ways to contribute to Data Carpentry, we’d like to focus each month on a different way that our volunteers are making an impact. This month, we’d like to start out by showcasing the efforts of our most active instructors. 

Every one of these Data Carpentry badged instructors has taught at least three workshops since January 2016, including at least one Data Carpentry workshop. Many are also actively involved in serving the Carpentry community in other ways.
