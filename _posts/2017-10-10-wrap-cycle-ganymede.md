We are wrapping up Cycle Ganymede. Here's what we accomplished over the past six weeks and what we're still working on. To
help with any of these projects, please [get in touch](mailto:team@carpentries.org)!

## Archiving Pre- and Post-Workshop Survey Data

**What did we do?**

During the previous work cycle, Data Carpentry launched new pre- and post-workshop surveys that included skills-based questions, 
and the ability for respondents to provide a unique identifier to facilitate future paired analyses. We archived the old 
survey data for Data Carpentry and created a draft RMarkdown report and plots for all of the data. Paula Andrea Martinez 
helped Kari Jordan with this. Because of the way the code is structured, there was no easy way to create a RMarkdown report 
that includes only selected plots. Hopefully, we will find a way round this for future reports.

**How can you help?**

If you're interested in other visualizations or analyses of our data, please contribute! [All our data 
and the code that generated this report](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment-projects) is available for reuse. We 
would love to see people with other questions or ideas use the data in their work or contribute for future reports.

## Long-term Survey Report

**What did we do?**

The results of the Carpentries long-term survey are extremely compelling, and we want to 
share them with a broader community. Accordingly, a team led by Kari Jordan is working to 
draft a manuscript around our long-term survey results. Assessment will be the topic of 
our [October 19 community call](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-10-19).

**How can you help?**

If you would like to know more about our assessment work, or if you would like to help out 
in some way, please join the [October 19 call](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-10-19). 
If you have recently attended a workshop, 
please [complete the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/carpentrieslongtermassessment). You 
can also join our [Google Group on assessment](https://groups.google.com/a/carpentries.org/forum/#!forum/assessment-network).

## Instructor Training Curriculum Lesson Release

**What did we do?**

Trainers and instructors did a [lot of work](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/08/inst-curr-update.html) readying 
our instructor training curriculum for the release of a new version. Thanks to all who took part. 
The material has now been published. [See it here](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).

**How can you help?**

If you are a Trainer teaching this material, please let us know if you find any errors or omissions by 
raising an issue on the [GitHub repository](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). We would also 
value more general feedback.

## Genomics Lesson Update

**What did we do?**

Many new and current Maintainers, as well as other members of our community, worked long and hard at both an 
Issue Bonanza and Bug BBQ to prepare the [Genomics Lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop) for 
release. Because of the number of outstanding issues and pull requests that need to be resolved, the release has 
been postponed to early November. A huge thank you to everyone who has been taking part in this release! 
You can see some of the milestones [here](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/genomics-bug-bbq/), 
[here](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/genomics-bonanza-today/) and [here](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/genomics-bbq/). 
In the Genomics curricula, we are also piloting a new approach involving a curriculum committee and more maintainers, 
and using a 'Looks Good to Me' model. Thanks to everyone who has been involved in this pilot model. 
There are still some things to figure out, and we will be updating this with a maintainers report, 
to see if this is a general model we can use for other curriculum. 

**How can you help?**

We would welcome assistance with both resolving issues and reviewing the outstanding pull requests. 
Please contact [Erin Becker](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org) if you can help. 

## FAQ Update

**What did we do?**

 As we prepare for a joint Carpentries, we plan to standardize information and procedures across 
 both organizations. During this cycle, the existing website FAQs were moved into HelpScout, during 
 which time they were also updated and tagged (some with multiple tags). Some new FAQs were created as well. 
 The website for the updated FAQs is http://info.carpentries.org/, and it is keyword-searchable.

**How can you help?**

Looking for the answer to something but can't find it? Reading through the 
FAQs and notice something that should be updated or edited? 
Please [let us know](mailto:team@carpentries.org) so we can update it or add it to the knowledge base. 

## What else?

During this cycle, all Software and Data Carpentry staff travelled to in Davis, California for a 
two-day, in-person meeting. [Read about what we achieved there](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/davis-inperson/).
