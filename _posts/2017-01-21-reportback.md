With support from Data Carpentry, I spent the last two weeks hanging out with some awesome scientists who are all passionate about the future of science. Here, I want to share some of the impact these two weeks have Data Carpentry community and for my professional development.

## Reproducible Research using Jupyter Notebooks: Curriculum Development Hackathon
On January 9-11, 2017, Data Carpentry hosted [a three-day hackathon](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/RR-Jupyter-Hackathon-Jan-2017/wiki) to  develop a two-day Data Carpentry workshop to teach reproducible research using the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). About 25 scientists from the US, Canada, and the UK gathered at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, and we made excellent progress developing [the reproducible research with Jupyter curriculum](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/rr-jupyter-workshop/).

Tracy Teal and Hilmar Lapp did an excellent job of organizing the event and keeping us on point. [The participants](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/RR-Jupyter-Hackathon-Jan-2017/wiki/Participant%20Intros) came from diverse backgrounds with a unique set of skills and expertise. On the first day, we all contributed to sketching out the general workshop overview and learning objectives. Then, we broke out into small groups to tackel the specific lessons. I worked closely with Erin Becker, Elizabeth Wickes, Daniel Soto, and Mike Pacer to develop the lesson on [publication and sharing](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/publication-RR-Jupyter). This particular lesson focuses on exporting reports for sharing, best practices for documenting your workwork, best practices for using metadata, and using DOIs and ORCiD to get credit for your scholarly work. 

Even thought the workshop curricula is not completely polished and ready to teach, we are all very proud of the made significant progress we collectively made. You can see workshop website [here](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/rr-jupyter-workshop/). I was one of a handful of attendees that R and R markdown more than iPython and Jupyter Notebooks. However, after seeing the notebook's power and utility, I'm really excited about adding this to my reproducible workflow. If you aren't convinced, check out this [gallery of awesome Jupyter and IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-and-IPython-Notebooks)!

**Want to contribute?** This curriculum is still being developed and revised on an ongoing basis.

## Reproducible Research using Jupyter Notebooks: Curriculum Development Hackathon
On January 17-21, 2017, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation hosted the [Data-Driven Discovery Postdoc and Early Career Researcher Symposium](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii). Over 50 young investigators supported from 14 different time zones gathered at Waikoloa Beach, Hawaii to network and discuss challenges and opportunities for research and careers in data science. The symposium was of the "un-conference" style that promoted group discussions among like-minded attendees and deemphasized traditional panels and speakers. 

Each day the participants engaged in ice-breaker activities that gave us a chance to meet and get to know nearly everyone of the attendees. You might think that it's a little cheesy to introduce yourself and also say your favorite confort who or which famous person you share a birthday with, but I was pleasantly surprised at how often those bits of helped the participants get to know each other better. 

Then, we all played a major role in crafting the agenda by pitching and then attending "birds of a feather" breakout sessions. You can see the diversity of suggested topics by viewing the [open and closed GitHub issues](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii/issues) or the [session notes](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii/tree/master/notes). One day I participated in a **breakout session about science communication**. It was awesome to hear how everyone struggled with and/or managed the tricky balance of doing science and communicating science. For our report back to the group, we listed some challenges and resources for science communication on big pieces of white board paper, which you can [view here](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii/blob/master/notes/ThursBOF-sci-communication.JPG). The next breakout session I attended was about **science activism**. It was a little unfortunate the symposium conflicted with the presidential inauguration and women's marches, but some of us stayed very engaged in what was happening five time zones away. The 15 or so of us in the activism group (for lack of a better word) are committed to staying in touch to share news and opportunities for promoting science awareness and literacy in our local and global communities. 

Overall, the symposium was #MooreUseful and #MooreInspiring than I anticipated. Coming off the high of creating a new Data Carpentry Hackathon, I was worried this symposium wouldn't have as much of an impact on my research and teaching, but I was wrong. On of the more useful things (in my opinion) was an around-the-room discussion of each person's favorite new tool; take a look at [this list](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii/blob/master/notes/tools-methods.md) to see the kind of tools and methods we shared. It was so inspiring to learn what the other grad students, postdocs, and research scientists were working on and to hear their career struggles and successes. I was able to synthesize tons of ideas for my future research and career, and my eyes have been opened to more of the challenges and opportunities that data-driven researchers are facing.  

I know that everyone how participated had an amazing time (an I don't just mean all the beach photos you may have seen with the hashtag #MooreData). It wasn't a perfect event, but I'm happy to say that the organizers were very receptive to hearing and responding to our critiques. Stay tuned for an update from the Moore Foundation about scope and impact of the event as well as for information about future symposia (fingers crossed).

## Thanks!
I especially want to thank Tracy for the opportunity to attend both of these events. I thank Hilmar Lapp, Fran√ßois Michonneau, Jasmine Nirody, Kellie Ottoboni,
Tracy Teal, and Jamie Whitacre for organizing the Hackathon and Chris Mentzel, Carly Strasser, and Natalie Caulk for organizing the symposium. I thank everyone who participated and helped make these events awesome! I thank Laura Noren for feedback on an earlier version of this post.
