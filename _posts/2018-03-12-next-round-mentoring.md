In February, we held our mentoring groups [virtual showcase](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/Mentoring-Groups-Virtual-Showcase/), 
and community members engaged with mentors and mentees virtually to hear about the accomplishments they made over the course 
of their mentoring experience. Not only were mentees able to finish their instructor checkout tasks and contribute to 
the [CarpentryCon](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) taskforce, mentors started local communities and reconnected with community 
members globally. 

You’ve expressed to us and each other the benefits these mentoring groups have had on your growth in and outside of the Carpentries. 
You are building powerful, and meaningful connections by developing peer communities. Because of that, we want to continue to 
support these groups, and give more community members the opportunity to join, either as a mentor, or a mentee.

The next round of mentoring groups will run from April 9th to August 13th. Get a head start on joining a mentoring group by 
attending one of two upcoming information sessions (to suit different time zones). Sessions will be held on March 
15th at [11:30 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Carpentries+Mentoring+Groups+Info+Session&iso=20180315T0730&p1=179&am=30) and [20:30 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Carpentries+Mentoring+Groups+Info+Session&iso=20180315T1630&p1=179). Sign up to attend either session on [this etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/mentorship-info).                                        

Applications for both mentors and mentees **are now open**, and due by March 23rd. Mentor 
applications are open to instructors who have taught at least two workshops. Mentee applications are open to 
instructors who have taught less than two workshops. If you’d like to serve as a mentor, please complete the [mentor application](https://goo.gl/forms/xKYytXTbI1PUo56C2).  If you’d like to be a mentee, please complete the [mentee application](https://goo.gl/forms/0Tiz8m1E2H5nlLus2).   

Many mentor/mentee relationships extend well beyond the program time. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to connect, 
learn, and grow with community members. Join a mentoring group!
