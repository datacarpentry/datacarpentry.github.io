The Bug BBQ is a Carpentry-wide event to improve all our lessons -- both existing Software and Data Carpentry lessons, and new releases. We welcome contributions from the Community on all of our lessons. If you want to contribute, but you are not sure where to start, head over to the  [Bug BBQ website](https://carpentries.github.io/2018-04-bug-bbq) where we will highlight how to get involved.

The Carpentries are preparing to publish the **Social Sciences** and the **Geospatial** Data Carpentry curricula on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). The Social Science Lessons will be published in April, and the Geospatial Lessons in June. This will be the first 
publication for these lessons. We regularly publish our lessons ([SWC](https://zenodo.org/communities/swcarpentry/), [DC](https://zenodo.org/communities/datacarpentry/)) 
to provide stable identifiers for polished versions of
the lessons. This enables referenced discussions of the lesson materials and gives contributors a verifiable product to cite on their CVs 
or resumes.

This release will include the following lessons:

##### Geospatial Curriculum

* [Introduction to Geospatial analysis](https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-spatial-data-management-intro)
* [Geospatial analysis in R](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-spatial-raster-vector-lesson)

##### Social Science Curriculum

* [Spreadsheet organization](https://github.com/datacarpentry/spreadsheets-socialsci)
* [SQL](https://github.com/datacarpentry/sql-socialsci)
* [Python](https://github.com/datacarpentry/python-socialsci)
* [OpenRefine](https://github.com/datacarpentry/openrefine-socialsci)
* [R](https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-socialsci)


## Get involved!

If you've made a contribution to one of these lessons, you're already an author. Help make sure the final product is polished and complete by getting involved in the lesson release.

We are organizing a Bug BBQ to prepare these lessons for release. The main goal for the Bug BBQ is to get the Geospatial and Social Science lessons ready for release. However, if you are a Maintainer for another lesson, and you are available and interested in getting some extra eyes on your lessons, let [François](mailto:francois@carpentries.org) know and we'll include your repository on the [Bug BBQ website](https://carpentries.github.io/2018-04-bug-bbq/index.html).

Keep an eye open for more information about the Bug BBQ!

We're excited to work with the community to release these lessons. Put these dates on [your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MG8zMTA0cmdiN2twN2FlOGJiZGFrNDZrY2ogZnJhbmNvaXMubWljaG9ubmVhdUBt&tmsrc=francois.michonneau%40gmail.com), and we'll send out reminders and updates too. These lessons belong to the community - help keep them great!


## What's a Bug BBQ?

During a Bug BBQ, the community gathers online to squash and grill as many bugs as possible to make our lessons polished and ready to be officially released.

This is a distributed event, so you don't have to go anywhere. We'll use GitHub, Slack, and a website to get organized. If you are part of a local Carpentries community with several people interested in taking part in the Bug BBQ, feel free to organize a real BBQ to feed the crowd. If you plan on getting together, let us know by opening an issue! We'll add you to the website so other people can join you.

## How long should I attend?

The Bug BBQ lasts almost 36 hours to accommodate working hours across the globe. We are a global community and we want everyone to have a chance to participate. Feel free to participate for as little or as long as you want. However, note that contributions made when sleep deprived are rarely the best ones.

If you are a Maintainer, please coordinate with the other Maintainers for your lesson to be ready to review, and provide feedback on the issues and pull requests that you will receive during the Bug BBQ.

## Who is the Bug BBQ for?

Everyone is welcome to participate even if you are not familiar with the content of the lessons. We need your help to find typos, issues with formatting, help new contributors submit pull requests, answer general questions, review suggested changes, and more!
