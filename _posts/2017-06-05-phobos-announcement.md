We’ve been enjoying the added focus and sense of accomplishment we’ve gained from working in cycles. If there’s
something you’re excited about for the next round, let us know! If you’d like to join (or organize) a team for
one of the next few cycles, let us know! Please post an issue on our
[conversations repo](https://github.com/carpentries/conversations/issues) or email [ebecker@carpentries.org](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org).

# Our third cycle - Cycle Phobos (May 29th through July 21st)  
Our third cycle started this week and goes through July 21st. We focused on planning this first week. Here’s what 
we’re hoping to accomplish in this cycle. 

## Working towards publication of Instructor Training and Data Carpentry Genomics curricula  
Jason Williams, Bob Freeman, Sue McClatchy, Mateusz Kuzak, Erin and Tracy are working on preparing for the first
publication of the Data Carpentry Genomics lessons. There is a lot of enthusiasm for this curriculum push, with 
over 70 people [interested in being involved](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfm4aMOdVt0kDLGzEaAAyhsjoOBcjL8s7TUnXxw-apvxemhmg/viewform?c=0&w=1)! During this cycle, we will be 
forming a Genomics curriculum advisory board, finding maintainers for each of the lessons, and cleaning up the 
repo organization. Towards the end of this cycle, we will be having an Issue Bonanza. Stay tuned for more 
information!  

Karen Word, Naupaka Zimmerman, Lex Nederbragt, Rayna Harris, Christina Koch and Erin are working with the rest of
the Trainer community to revamp the Instructor Training curriculum for its next release in August. We’ll be 
having an Issue Bonanza July 13th and 14th and a Bug BBQ August 3rd and 4th. Keep an eye out for more 
announcements about these events!  

## Developing a guide for Trainers  
Maneesha is working on putting together documentation and checklists for Trainers running instructor training 
events. If you’re a Trainer and have any questions or issues of unclarity surrounding instructor training events, 
please send your thoughts to  [Maneesha](mailto:maneesha@carpentries.org) as she’s gathering information for this 
documentation.  

## Pursuing funding for specific efforts  
Data Carpentry has been focusing closely on curriculum development in the past months and is committed to 
continuing those efforts over the next year. During this cycle, we are focusing on pursuing more resources to 
help us maintain high quality lessons and expand our curricular offerings into new domains. 

In addition to growth in new domains, Data and Software Carpentry are committed to improving our ability to serve 
learners in underserved regions. Anelda van der Walt has led growth efforts in Africa and had great success in 
starting to establish a Carpentry community on the continent. This is a big job! We’re now seeking funding to 
help support workshop coordination and other work necessary to support new Carpentry communities, in both Africa 
and Latin America. If you have ties to these regions and are interested in helping secure funding for these 
efforts, please contact [Erin](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org).

## Communication around assessment  
Kari is working on developing a plan for communicating the results of our long-term follow-up survey to both the 
Carpentry community and the wider data science community. She’s also cleaning up and archiving pre- and
post-workshop survey data so that this information is more accessible to interested members of the community. 
During this cycle, she will also be leading an effort to complete a report of the  post-workshop survey results 
from Software Carpentry’s workshops thus far.  If you are interested in being involved with these efforts, check 
out the [carpentry community assessment projects repo](https://github.com/kariljordan/carpentry-community-assessment-projects).  

## Small batch projects  
- Erin is working on recruiting new instructor Trainers. Particularly people with ties to Africa and Latin America. If you’re interested in becoming a Trainer, please [apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchAJhZiLSVmqSab1QxG1H30tCAHg_BcUwfctnJpzIhOVo1Bg/viewform?c=0&w=1)!   
- Thanks to growth in the Trainer community, we are now able to offer more instructor training events for 
individuals who aren’t affiliated with member sites. We’re working now on organizing some of these events for 
the coming months. If you’ve been on the waitlist for training, please keep an eye out for an update!  
- Tracy is working on finalizing and communicating new Data Carpentry policies around reimbursements, staff
professional development and workshops for for-profit institutions.    
- A while back we collected input from our Advisory board. We’ve been looking through their feedback and are 
working on communicating about it and planning follow-up actions.  

## Continuing Work  
We’re also continuing to work on our many ongoing projects, including (but not limited to):
- Publishing our monthly newsletter  
- Running our blogs  
- Maintaining our websites and lessons  
- Coordinating workshops and instructor training events  
- Teaching at workshops and instructor training events  
- Hosting discussion sessions and instructor teaching demos  
- Speaking publically about Data and Software Carpentry  
- Running our Virtual Assessment Network  
- Organizing our Mentorship Program  
- Serving on the mentoring subcommittee, trainers group and bridge subcommittees  

If you’re interested in helping with any of this ongoing work, or would like to make suggestions about what to tackle in our next cycle, let us know! Please post an issue on our [conversations repo](https://github.com/carpentries/conversations/issues) or email [ebecker@carpentries.org](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org).

Our next two cycles will be:  
- Cycle Ganymede - July 24th through September 15th  
- Cycle Callisto - September 18th through November 10th
