After workshops and conferences, we frequently get questions from people who are interested in teaching with the
Carpentries. We’re overjoyed by this interest and excited to bring more committed and enthusiastic instructors
into the Carpentry community. Unfortunately, until recently, we haven’t had the resources to open up our
instructor training program, and have been holding training events primarily with
[Partnering institutions](/partnerships/).  


In response to this sustained community interest, Data and Software Carpentry recently re-opened applications for 
our instructor training program. This two-day intensive training covers aspects of pedagogy critical for teaching
our target audience, including creating useful formative assessments, motivating learners, dealing with cognitive
load, and understanding how subject-matter expertise is developed. We also teach signature Carpentry
instructional practices, including live coding and the use of sticky notes to track learner progress.    


Within three weeks of calling for applicants we received 169 applications for 60 available seats. Applications
came in from around the world, including 22 countries spread across all continents except Antarctica. We’re
excited to see this geographical breadth, as we continue to work to develop and support active Carpentry
communities in new regions.  


The Carpentry team reviewed applications on the basis of applicant’s previous involvement with the Carpentries,
previous teaching experience and/or formal pedagogical training and commitment to teaching at our workshops.
In addition to these criteria, we looked for applicants from locations outside of our already established
communities or with training in domains that are underrepresented among our current instructor pool.   


We were able to make offers to applicants from 13 countries representing the geographical breadth of those
who applied. Four training sessions have been planned, all of which are being held synchronously online.  


If you were not selected for this round of instructor training, we encourage you to apply again at the next call
for applicants. If you also have colleagues who are interested in teaching for the Carpentries, consider asking
your institution to [Partner](/partnerships/) with us! Partnering institutions receive multiple benefits,
including reserved seats in instructor training events and discounted workshops.  


Although we weren’t able to offer seats to everyone who applied, we would like to sincerely thank all of our
wonderful applicants. We hope that you will continue to be involved in the Carpentry community. We welcome
contributions to our lessons, which are all developed collaboratively by our community, and encourage you to
help at our [host a Carpentry workshop](/workshops-host/) at your institution.
