## Guiding Data Carpentry

We've been excited to see the enthusiasm of the community for
Data Carpentry workshops and materials, and in the months ahead want to be able to engage all the people who are interested in participating as instructors, developers, hosts, sponsors, learners or anything else. We want to have good infrastructure and guidelines that can help make
efforts the most effective.

On November 15, 2014 the Data Carpentry Board
had an in-person meeting to assess our current progress and plan for future
development and expansion.

The goals of this meeting were to discuss and determine what Data Carpentry
will do in the short term, how it will grow and integrate with the community, and how it will coordinate workshops in order
to continue to develop and establish a sustainable path going forward.

First, we must give a big thanks to Katy Tackett at [Launch Pad](http://lp.co/nola) in New Orleans for letting us use their
meeting space! (We wish we could work there all the time.) Also travel support from [SESYNC](http://www.sesync.org) ([NSF](http://www.nsf.gov) DBI-1052875) was invaluable in making this meeting possible.

The decisions made during this meeting are listed below. Many of these decisions still require more
details on how they will be implemented, and those details are coming soon as
we continue to develop our infrastructure and guidelines, so please continue to stay tuned, ask questions if you
have them on our [discuss list](http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/dc-discuss) or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/datacarpentry) or [contact us](mailto:admin@datacarpentry.org).

### Data Carpentry Board Meeting 
**15 November 2014**

**All members were present**  
* Karen Cranston (National Evolutionary Synthesis Center)  
* Hilmar Lapp (National Evolutionary Synthesis Center / Duke University)  
* Aleksandra Pawlik (The Software Sustainability Institute, University of Manchester)  
* Karthik Ram (UC Berkeley, rOpenSci)  
* Tracy Teal (Data Carpentry / BEACON)  
* Ethan White (Utah State Univ/Univ of Florida)  
* Greg Wilson (Software Carpentry Foundation)  


#### Data Carpentry Workshop Content ####

**Decision:** For
the next six months,
Data Carpentry will focus on creating and delivering one core product
(with variations for different disciplines, but at the same conceptual level).

**Decision:** The board agrees that the core product be entry level.

**Decision:** The board will define a plan for allowing the
community to manage our
feature backlog in an appropriate way.

**Decision:** Data Carpentry will implement a public forum in which the
community can propose new features and upvote/downvote them, but that it be
advisory only, and that the board make a sustained commitment to responding
to user input through this forum.

**Decision:** In the next 8 weeks we will discuss and establish a
repository organization and template for lessons.

**Decision:** The board will establish contribution guidelines for Data
Carpentry material that ensure consistent quality, usability for teaching, and
continued engagement of contributors. These guidelines will support both the
further development of core material and development of new material beyond
the core.

**Decision:** We will solicit lesson contributions and recruit
instructors to ensure a diverse, representative pool of contributors.

#### Workshops and Instructors ####

**Decision:** We will aim for 24 workshops in the first calendar
year (2015). The board will create a form for workshop requests and
will establish criteria for approving.

*(Some workshops have already been approved including AAAS, Cornell, SESYNC, Kansas
  and Stanford and other conversations are ongoing.)*

**Decision:** To ensure long-term sustainability of the project,
Data Carpentry will begin charging host institutions a fee for organizing
workshops. The board may waive such fees at its discretion.

**Decision:** The board will come up with a concrete set of criteria to
certify
Data Carpentry instructors within the next 8 weeks. In the meantime,
we will continue to add instructors to the pool at the discretion of the board.


#### Community, Diversity and Accessibility ####

**Decision:** Data Carpentry considers diversity a key value in every aspect of its
operations.

**Decision:** Data Carpentry adopts a Code of Conduct for both its workshops and
participation in its community.

**Decision:** Data Carpentry aspires that its website, workshop events,
and lesson materials be accessible to learners with disabilities, and as a
minimum, that workshops have their level of accessibility documented.

#### Administration and Organization ####

**Decision:** Data Carpentry will define its mission, governance,
and activities independently of, but in coordination with, related efforts.

**Decision:** Motions approved in board meetings will be made public
within one week of meetings.

*We have a backlog from previous meetings, but future meetings will comply with
this decision.*

**Decision:** The board will pursue signing a Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement (FSA)
 with NumFOCUS, and the
signatories will be Tracy Teal, Ethan White, and Hilmar Lapp
