We are delighted to announce that SherAaron Hurt has accepted the job of [Workshop Administrator](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/ws-admin/) with the Carpentries. SherAaron is joining our team of workshop coordinators who manage workshop logistics, communicate with hosts and instructors, and respond to general workshop inquiries.

SherAaron lives in Detroit, Michigan, USA. She has been very active in the National Society of Black Engineers, and has a strong background in logistics, marketing, and training and managing both staff and volunteers. Not only has she planned and run events both large and small, but she has a Masters in hospitality management to back up her experience. She is passionate about Software and Data Carpentry’s mission of teaching foundational computational and data skills to researchers, and is keen to help ‘lighten the load’ for instructors and workshop hosts. 

You’ll be seeing emails from her soon, and you can contact SherAaron at team@carpentries.org. Welcome SherAaron!
