I love [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com).

I only use them for work I care about. Examples include lesson development for R workshops, my recent performance review 
packet, and collaborative projects on species distribution modeling. Oh, and Software Carpentry workshop websites (obviously).

#### Why I like Git: 

The version control system and the companion remote host system (GitHub or Bitbucket or CloudForge, etc.) provide a 
great versioning and collaboration platform, the highlights of which have been enumerated many times over and in such depth that 
I won't talk about them here.

The reason I like this dynamic duo is that it reinforces best practices. I should say that using version control won't 
necessarily make you 100% compliant with everyone's idea of best practices, but with a little consideration of a workflow, it can go 
a long way. Here is why: 

1. *Reproducibility*: By ignoring my `output` folder in pretty much all my Git repositories, it forces all figures & analyses to be completely 
reproducible from materials that are in the folders that _are_ tracked.

2. *Offsite backup*: Rather than lugging my aging laptop to and fro, `pull-add-commit-push` allows me to preserve my work in a 
location accessible from any internet-enabled terminal. This has the added benefit of protecting against natural disasters and the 
inevitable bricked hard drive (mark my words, death, taxes, and a failed HD are the only certainties in life now).

3. *Sharing*: Sure, some of what I currently work on is not ready to be released, so I use the private repository option. But when 
I _am_ ready to share my code and data, it's literally one to two mouseclicks and my work is open for re-use by the community. The 
visibility of platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) make work that much more discoverable.

4. *Documentation*: Everybody's favorite part of software development is ... not likely writing documentation (granted there are some 
of you out there). Because good documentation is imperative for re-use and evaluation, the little reminders from GitHub 
("Help people interested in this repository understand your project by adding a README") further encourage best practices for 
open research. The support for markdown rendering on GitHub makes it especially nice for writing professional-looking documentation of your work.

Sure, I ~~struggled~~ struggle sometimes with Git syntax and concepts, but 98% of the time I only use four 
commands (`pull-add-commit-push`, remember?) and the Git/GitHub combo reduces the time I spend developing, 
preserving, and sharing the work I do.
