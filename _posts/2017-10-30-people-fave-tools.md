A big thank you to everyone who has responded so far to the call for short posts about their favourite tools.

So far we have had [Paula Martinez](https://twitter.com/orchid00) on [R](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/my-fave-tool.html), 
Jeff Oliver sharing his love of [Git and GitHub](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/oliver-fave.html),
[Kellie Ottoboni](https://twitter.com/kellieotto) talking up [IPython](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/ottoboni-fave.html), 
and Thomas Arildsen on 
how the [Jupyter Notebook](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/arildsen-fave.html) facilitates his teaching. [Juliane Schneider](https://twitter.com/JulianeS) has now weighed in on the [wonders of OpenRefine](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/schneider-fave.html).

Expect more posts as people contribute further favourites. Even if your tool has already been mentioned, we would still welcome a post about it,
as your use of the tool may be different.
