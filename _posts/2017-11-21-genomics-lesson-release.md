Thanks to a Herculean effort from our Maintainers, the long-awaited Data Carpentry Genomics lessons have now been published on Zenodo! These lessons were originally developed through a hackathon in 2014, and have gone through several major rounds of revision since then. We had an [Issue Bonanza in August](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/genomics-bonanza-today/) and a  [Bug BBQ in September](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/genomics-bug-bbq/), with contributions from dozens of community members. 

These contributions were critical to transforming the initial lesson drafts into a polished version, ready for teaching by any Carpentry instructor with a Genomics background. As with our previous lesson release, every contributor is an author, so thank you to all who have been involved!

Extra thanks to Anita Schürch, Fotis Psomopoulos, Tracy Teal, and Amanda Charbonneau for their quick response time to pull requests and issues and their eagle-eyed proofreading.  Also a special thank you to all of the Genomics Maintainers, who put in a huge effort to reorganize and clean up these lessons over the past several months. 

[Overview of the Genomics Data Carpentry workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/)  
This workshop teaches data management and analysis for genomics research including: best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use of command line utilities, use of command line tools to analyze sequence quality and perform variant calling, and connecting to and using cloud computing.

Please note that the R Genomics Lesson has not yet been released, as the Maintainers for that lesson are working on a major overhaul and re-focusing of those materials. If you are interested in being involved with that re-design, please check out the [repo](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-genomics/).

Thanks again to everyone for helping get these lessons ready for teaching! We're looking forward to seeing many more Genomics workshops happening soon and hearing back from you all about your experiences teaching these materials.
