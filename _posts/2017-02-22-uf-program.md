This January was the one year anniversary of our effort to bring regular
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and  [Data
Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops to the University of
Florida. These workshops are aimed at helping students, staff, and faculty gain
the computing skills they need to be successful in our data-driven world. The
Carpentries are international organizations that provide materials, instructor
certification, and organization of multi-day workshops on basic software
development and data analysis tools. In January 2016 a Software Carpentry
instructor training workshop held at the University of Florida Informatics
Institute provided the start of our efforts. Since then, instructors trained
here as well as experienced instructors already in the UF community have held
four workshops, reaching 98 participants, including 70 students, 14 staff and 11
faculty. The participants received training in programming languages like R and
Python, version control with Git and GitHub, SQL database queries, OpenRefine,
and Excel spreadsheets.

Such a robust and recurring workshop pattern is uncommon in the Carpentries
community ([but not
unprecedented](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/uwcommunity/)) and it is a
result of the generosity and volunteerism of a combination of staff, faculty,
students, and organizations at UF. Together we recognized that members of the UF
community did not have enough opportunities to get hands-on experience with the
software development and data analysis tools they need to be effective
researchers, employees, and future job-seekers. In response, we have established
a highly collaborative process for giving our fellow UF community members,
whether they are students, staff, or faculty, this opportunity.



## Our Year of Workshops

Though UF has a longer history with the Data and Software Carpentry communities,
the start of this current program was an [instructor training
workshop](http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-florida-2016-01-21/) held in
January 2016 at the [UF Informatics
Institute](https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/) (UFII). [Dr. Ethan
White](http://whitelab.weecology.org/user/3) provided funds (through [a grant
from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/article-
detail?newsUrlName=the-gordon-and-betty-moore-foundation-selects-awardees-
for-$21-million-in-grants-to-stimulate-data-driven-discovery)) for UF to become
a Software Carpentry Foundation affiliate member and to run an on-site training
for instructors. Fourteen people from UF attended the 2016 workshop, 5 came from
other Florida institutions, and 4 from elsewhere in the US and Canada. As a
result of this workshop, 8 participants from UF became newly certified
instructors for Software or Data Carpentry. Today there are a total of 10 active
instructors at UF.

Several existing instructors, including [Matthew
Collins](https://www.acis.ufl.edu/people/mjcollin) from the Advanced Computing
and Information Systems Lab and [Dr. François
Michonneau](https://francoismichonneau.net/) from the Whitney Laboratory for
Marine Bioscience, with the help of the newly trained instructors, then
approached the director of the UF Informatics Institute, [Dr. George
Michailidis](https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/about-us/michailidis/), for
logistical support to run a Software Carpentry workshop in March 2016. While it
was very successful, only 16 participants of 31 who signed up attended. We did
not charge a registration fee, so we believe that many people simply did not
show up when another commitment arose.

For our second workshop, held in August 2016 just before the start of the
semester, [Alethea Geiger](https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/about-
us/staff/) from the UFII worked with the UF Conference Department to set up an
account and a registration page that accepted credit card payments. We were able
to charge a $30 registration fee which allowed us to pay for lunch during the
workshop. This amount appears to strike a good balance between using a
registration fee to encourage attendance and cover catering costs while not
imposing serious financial hardship for participants with limited funding.
However, the Conference Department web site did not let us smoothly deal with
waitlists and capacity caps, and over the first weekend we had more than 35
people sign up for the workshop. In order to accommodate everyone, the Marston
Science Library generously offered a larger room for the workshop. Everyone who
registered attended this workshop.

In October 2016, we held our third workshop using the Data Carpentry curriculum.
At this workshop we had the honor of having [Dr. Kari L.
Jordan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kariljordan) as a participant. Dr. Jordan
was recently hired as the Data Carpentry organization’s director of assessment
and this was her first experience at a workshop. The registration process worked
smoothly this time and were able to use the UFII conference room for the
workshop and catering. Our most recent event was another Software Carpentry
workshop held at the UFII in February 2017.


## What it Takes

This group’s volunteered time as well as the coordination and support of three
existing instructors and the logistics supplied by the Informatics Institute
have made it possible to reliably host Carpentry workshops. It currently takes
about 8 hours for the lead instructor to arrange instructors, helpers, and
announcements and to respond to attendee questions. The staff at the UFII spend
another 8 hours managing registration and preparing the catering. Instructors
spend between 4 and 12 hours preparing to teach depending on whether they have
taught the lesson before. Helpers who are already familiar with the content of
the lessons usually don’t need further preparation but new helpers spend 4 to 8
hours reviewing lessons and software installation instructions. Combined, each
workshop takes about 40 person-hours of preparation and over 80 person-hours to
host. With the exception of the UFII staff, this time is all volunteered.

How do we keep people volunteering? There are a number of factors that go into
maintaining volunteers’ motivation and momentum. We didn’t plan these in advance
but now that we have them in place, we recognize them as the reasons we can
continue to keep our community engaged and excited about putting on workshops.

1. **Instructor density** - have enough instructors to get 3-6 people at each 
workshop without burdening anyone’s schedule 
1. **Instructor cohesion** - just like we suggest learners attend workshops with 
a buddy, instructors who come to the instructor training from the same 
department or discipline immediately make their own community of practice 
1. **Instructor mentorship** - a core group of senior instructors to guide 
initial workshops (note the plural) so new instructors can focus on the teaching
experience without the logistical burdens
1. **Professional staff** - find staff who organize workshops as part of their 
job to share the overhead of coordinating logistics 
1. **Institution-level support** - a single research lab or department doesn’t 
have enough people to do this on its own, doing it for the whole institution 
fits the needs of everyone and shares the work 
1. **Follow-through** - have supporting events and communities available for 
people to keep learning and keep their experience with the Carpentries fresh in 
their minds when it comes time to look for more instructors and helpers


## Community Building After the Workshops

Some of the instructors have also been involved in creating and helping
communities of learners on campus grow outside of workshops. Dr. Michonneau
started a Meetup.com group for the Gainesville community focused on R. M.
Collins is an advisor to the [UF Data Science and
Informatics](http://www.dsiufl.org/) student organization which holds about 12
evening workshops each semester focused on building data science skills for UF
students. In spring 2017 [Dr. Daniel
Maxwell](http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/msl/About/Faculty/maxwell) , Informatics
Librarian for the Marston Science Library, re-invigorated the UF R Users mailing
list and is holding weekly in-person drop-in sessions. These venues allow former
workshop participants to continue learning the skills taught in the Carpentry
workshops. They provide a space where participants can ask questions of and
interact with their peers when they start using the tools taught in the
workshops for their own research. This ongoing communal engagement is proving to
be a key factor in making sure workshop participants continue to develop their
abilities.

## UF’s Impact on the Carpentry Community

UF has a long history and deep connections to the Carpentries. Data Carpentry
was originally imagined during the 2013 COLLAB-IT meeting between the IT members
of [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/) (a large NSF-sponsored project centered
at UF) and the other NSF biocenters. The attendees of this two-day workshop
found that one important need shared by the biocenters was a training program
for researchers, focused on the novice, to develop software skills and data
literacy for analyzing their data. Some attendees were involved with Software
Carpentry and decided to develop a curriculum based on Software Carpentry’s
teaching principles. Dr. White, as well as iDigBio staff including [Deborah
Paul](https://www.idigbio.org/contact/Deborah_Paul), Dr. Michonneau, and M.
Collins were instructors, helpers, and attendees at the prototype Data Carpentry
workshop held in May 2014 at NESCENT facility at Duke University. The second
official Data Carpentry workshop was put on by the iDigBio project right here at
UF.

Since this first engagement with the Carpentries, many other members of the UF
community have participated in Software and Data Carpentry workshops across the
country. Not all have participated in this most recent effort to run workshops
here on campus and some have moved on to other institutions but they have all
contributed to UF being a valued organization in the Carpentries community.

In addition to building its own workshop infrastructure, UF is helping to
advance the Carpentry programs in the US and globally. Dr. White is a founding
Data Carpentry steering committee member, a member of the Software Carpentry
Advisory Council, and has developed [a semester-long
course](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2016/11/14/fork-our-course-a-semester-
long-data-carpentry-course-for-biologists/) based on Data Carpentry materials
that he has taught twice as WIS6934 through the Department of Wildlife Ecology.
Through the iDigBio project and support from Dr. White, M. Collins and D. Paul
have taught workshops in [Nairobi, Kenya](https://www.idigbio.org/content
/idigbio-and-data-carpentry-go-africa) and Santa Clara, [Costa
Rica](https://www.idigbio.org/content/software-carpentry- goes-tdwg-and-costa-
rica-two-firsts) before the Biodiversity Information Standards conferences in
2015 and 2016. M. Collins has also served as a mentor to instructors trained
during the [South African instructor training](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/01/a-year-of-swc-in-south-africa.html) and along with D.
Paul has more recently become a member of the formal Carpentry mentorship
program providing on-going support to new instructors across the country.



## Going Forward

The success of our group has been the result of the serendipitous meeting of
interested UF community members, an existing international teaching community,
and informal funding and infrastructure support. We are now looking for a way to
formalize UF’s commitment to building capacity in informatics skills for its
staff, students, and faculty through an on-going structure.

To start this process, a consortium of labs and institutes at the University of
Florida have combined resources to sponsor a joint Gold Partnership with
Software and Data Carpentry going forward. The UF partners are Dr. White’s lab,
the UF Biodiversity Institute (via [Dr. Pamela Soltis](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu
/museum-voices/soltis-lab/people/principal-investigators/)), iDigBio (via Dr.
Soltis), and the UF Informatics Institute (via Dr. Michailidis). This
partnership will provide annual instructor training opportunities to grow the
instructor community

To continue the rest of the key parts of our success, we still need:

1. A UF department or institute to adopt the goal of informatics capacity 
building for the UF community.
1. An individual to be given the task of coordinating this goal across UF. 
1. Continuous funding and resources to provide for a pipeline of people capable 
of meeting this goal.

We believe UF has a unique opportunity to create a sustainable effort that cuts
across individual departments and research labs. While existing on-book courses
and department-specific programs are available, we have shown that there is need
for hands-on, community-led informatics skill development for everyone on campus
regardless of affiliation or discipline. By approaching this need at the
university level we can maintain the critical mass of expertise and motivation
to make our staff more productive, our students more employable, and our
faculty’s research more innovative.
