[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) have combined
their separate projects into a new project, now known as The Carpentries.

As part of this transition, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are moving from Fiscally Sponsored Projects
with [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/) to The Carpentries with [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/),
whose fiscal sponsorship administration services
are better aligned with our emerging needs. The Carpentries looks forward to new opportunities with NumFOCUS and
will continue to participate in the NumFOCUS Community as a new member of the NumFOCUS Community Alliance.

As a Community Alliance member, we will be one of the organizations whose mission intersects with that of NumFOCUS
and reflects support for open source scientific computing. NumFOCUS cross-promotes activities and events held by
members of their Community Alliance in a reciprocal, supportive relationship. In particular, both organizations
share a commitment to increasing diversity and inclusion in the data community.

Software Carpentry joined NumFOCUS as a fiscally sponsored project in 2014, and Data Carpentry joined NumFOCUS as a
fiscally sponsored project in 2015. Over the ensuing years both Carpentries worked closely together and in early 2017
[began discussions](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/02/merger-discussion.html) about a merger. The merger was
approved last summer, and this January marks the [milestone](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/06/merger.html) of a fully
merged project, The Carpentries, with a newly-elected [Executive Council](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/executive-council-2018.html).

We are very grateful for the support of NumFOCUS through the initiation, development and growth of Software and Data Carpentry,
and for their continued support through this transition to The Carpentries with Community Initiatives. We look forward to
continuing to work closely with NumFOCUS as a member of their Community Alliance, to promote the growth and
development of the open source scientific computing community.
