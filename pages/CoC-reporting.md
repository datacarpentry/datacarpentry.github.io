If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it to the joint Data/Software
Carpentry (“the Carpentries”) Policy subcommittee by emailing C. MacDonnell at
[confidential@carpentries.org](mailto:confidential@carpentries.org).
**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be
made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those
individuals instruct us otherwise.  

If the violation occurred at an in-person event, please contact the event host and/or coordinator so that they
can take any appropriate immediate response, as well as contacting the subcommittee. You can also contact
Carpentry executive staff by telephone at 1-530-341-3230 (Tracy Teal - Data Carpentry) or 1-765-532-1126 (Jonah Duckles - Software Carpentry).  

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first.** If you are unsure
which law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
them.  

Reports can be filed anonymously with minimal details. If you don’t feel you can provide details, we would still
like to be aware that an incident occurred. Our ability to act is impacted by the amount of information you can
provide however, so, if you can, please include in your report:  

- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).  
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.  
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.  
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a GitHub discussion) please include a link.  
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.  
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.  
- Any other information you believe we should have.  

**What happens after you file a report?**    
The recipient of the report will attempt to ensure your safety and help with any immediate needs, 
particularly at an in-person event. You will receive an email from the Policy subcommittee (“the committee”)
acknowledging receipt within 24 hours (and we’ll aim for much more quickly than that). The committee will make all efforts to meet within two days to review the incident and determine:  

- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.  
- What happened.  
- Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.  
- Who the bad actor was, if any.  

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the committee’s immediate
priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe
that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.  

Once the committee has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:  

- Nothing (if we determine that no violation occurred)  
- A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved  
- A public announcement that an incident occurred  
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list) 
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Carpentry spaces (mailing lists, GitHub repos, in-person events, etc.)  
- Assistance to the complainant with a report to other bodies, for example, institutional offices or appropriate law enforcement agencies  


We'll respond within one week to the original reporter with either a resolution or an explanation of why the
situation is not yet resolved.   

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) 
we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but
we may decide not to act on that feedback.  

Finally, the committee will make a report on the situation to the appropriate Carpentry steering committee. 
The steering committee may choose to make a public report of the incident, while maintaining anonymity of those
involved.  

**Appealing**

Only resolutions with permanent consequences (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the 
committee, contact the appropriate Carpentry steering committee at 
[board@software-carpentry.org](mailto:board@software-carpentry.org) or 
[board@datacarpentry.org](mailto:board@datacarpentry.org) with your appeal and the 
steering committee will review the case.
