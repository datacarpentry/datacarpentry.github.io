## Assessment Network Goals
The goals of the assessment network include:
+ Comparing assessment efforts across various programs.
+ Discussing strategies for measuring and assessing research computing productivity.
+ Managing and sharing resources (quantitative/qualitative tools and approaches) across countries.
