Data Carpentry is a sibling organization of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) designed to teach fundamental concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.

From astronomy to molecular biology, our increasing capacity
to collect data is changing science. It allows us to ask questions that previously could 
not have been answered, and it changes the impact that science has on society.
Although petabytes of data are now available, most scientific disciplines are 
failing to translate this sea of data into scientific advances. The missing step between 
data collection and research progress is a lack of training for researchers in crucial 
skills for effectively managing and analyzing large amounts of data.

Data Carpentry addresses this gap by teaching researchers the fundamental data skills they 
need to conduct their work. Our goal is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific 
training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. We teach hands-on workshops in 
data organization, management, and analysis to increase data literacy and improve research 
efficiency. Our domain-specific approach allows us to tailor the data, content, and tools 
to reflect the specific data and analysis needs of different areas. Domain specificity also 
allows us to build new skills on knowledge frameworks familiar to learners, and to motivate 
workshops using real scientific questions and data relevant to the learners' field of study. 
This approach allows learners to see immediate value in the skills they are learning and to 
put new techniques immediately into practice. 

A workshop can't teach a researcher everything they need to know about data management and analysis, however it drastically reduces the barrier to entry and imparts the skills for continued learning and engagement. Our ultimate goal is to enable data-driven research in diverse disciplines by creating strong communities of data scientists and empowering them to conduct more innovative and effective research. 

### People
Our staff and leadership are committed to furthering Data Carpentry's goals
of developing and providing training to enable data-driven discovery. Our
people plan, learn, adapt and engage
with the community of learners, developers and volunteer instructors to 
meet these goals.

### Governance

Data Carpentry is a Fiscally Sponsored Project of [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org), a 501(c)3 organization. Data Carpentry is governed by a volunteer 
[Steering Committee](/people/index.html#sc) and run by its [Staff](/people/index.html#staff). 
[Resolutions](/resolutions/) and [minutes](/minutes/) of meetings are made publicly available.

Staff and Steering Committee members are committed to ensuring that activities are
welcoming and inclusive, and the organization and all its events and communications
adhere to a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).
