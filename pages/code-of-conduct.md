Data Carpentry is a community organization. We value the involvement of every one
in this community - learners, instructors, hosts, developers, steering committee
members and staff. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning,
teaching and contributing. All participants in Data Carpentry events or communications
are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can and can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit
in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the
communities in which we participate.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Data Carpentry activities is
required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This code of conduct applies to
all spaces managed by Data Carpentry, including, but not
limited to, workshops, email lists, online forums and on GitHub.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by
emailing Tracy Teal, [tkteal@datacarpentry.org](mailto:tkteal@datacarpentry.org) or
any of the [Steering Committee members](/people/). You may also contact Gina Helfrich
(gina @ numfocus.org) at NumFOCUS, our sponsoring organization. All communication will
be treated as confidential.

### Code of Conduct

Data Carpentry is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
nationality, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many
different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event or
communication.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.

- Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes
are not appropriate.

- Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event or cease corresponding
with the community at the sole discretion of
the organizers without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

This code of conduct is an adaptation of the one used by the [Software Carpentry Foundation](http://www.software-carpentry.org) and is a modified version of that used by [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2015/about/code-of-conduct/), which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the [Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy).
