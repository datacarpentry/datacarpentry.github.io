Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry are community organizations. 
We value the involvement of everyone in this community - learners, instructors, hosts, developers, steering
committee members and staff. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, 
teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect 
and courtesy to others.  
 
To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry activities 
is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by
Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, online forums and 
on GitHub. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with enforcement of the Code of Conduct.  

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it to the joint Data/Software Carpentry (“the Carpentries”) Policy subcommittee by emailing [policy@carpentries.org](mailto:policy@carpentries.org) or 
C. MacDonnell at [confidential@carpentries.org](mailto:confidential@carpentries.org), and if the violation occurs during a
workshop or other in-person event,
by contacting the host and/or coordinator. All reports will be kept confidential.  When possible, please follow
the reporting guidelines detailed [here](/CoC-reporting/). All reports will be reviewed by the Conduct Policy
subcommittee. A detailed enforcement policy can be found [here](/CoC-enforcement/).

### Code of Conduct

Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all
people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject
to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific
group can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial
status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a
national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants
on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a
diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions.
Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent.
Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:  

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above  
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation  
- the display of sexual or violent images  
- unwelcome sexual attention  
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact  
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications  
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm  
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop  
- publication of private communication without consent  

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as
exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we
participate. All Carpentry interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited
whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.  

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.  

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.  

This code of conduct is an adaptation of the one used by the Software Carpentry Foundation and is a modified
version of that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted
on the Geek Feminism Wiki. Contributors to this document: Adam Obeng, Aleksandra Pawlik, Bill Mills, Carol
