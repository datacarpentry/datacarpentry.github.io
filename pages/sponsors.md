![NumFOCUS](/images/numfocus_logo.png)  
We are a fiscally sponsored project of [NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org), a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.
Their aim to promote the use of accessible and reproducible computing in science and technology through educational programs, the promotion of high-level languages, reproducible scientific research, and open-code development, and an increase in collaborative research tools and documentation.

![Software Carpentry](/images/software-carpentry-banner.png)  
Data Carpentry is a spin-off organization of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and we continue to be closely aligned. We are extremely grateful for their collaboration
and support. Their mission is to teach researchers basic lab skills for scientific computing: the tools and techniques that will help them get more done in less time, and with less pain.



## Sponsors

### Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation

We are extremely grateful for the support of the [Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation](http://moore.org) Data-Driven Discovery program. We have received 
a grant as a part of their efforts to support the [Practice](https://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/ddd-practices) of data driven discovery. 

With more than $6.4 billion in assets, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is the ninth largest foundation in the United States. The Science Program accounts for approximately 40 percent of the foundation’s annual grant making, making the foundation one of the largest private funders of science nationwide.

### National Science Foundation

Initial efforts on Data Carpentry were funded by the National Science Foundation and the CollabIT efforts across the NSF BIO Centers, as well as by DataONE.

The Project Lead, Dr. Tracy Teal, was supported by [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org) at Michigan State University.
