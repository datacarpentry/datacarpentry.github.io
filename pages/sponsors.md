## Sponsors

### Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation

We are extremely grateful for the support of the [Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation](http://moore.org) Data-Driven Discovery program, through grant #4855 to Data Carpentry via NumFOCUS and now Community Initiatives. This 
grant is a part of their efforts to support the [Practice](https://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/ddd-practices) of data driven discovery. 

With more than $6.4 billion in assets, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is the ninth largest foundation in the United States. The Science Program accounts for approximately 40 percent of the foundationâ€™s annual grant making, making the foundation one of the largest private funders of science nationwide.

### National Science Foundation

Initial efforts on Data Carpentry were funded by the National Science Foundation and the CollabIT efforts across the NSF BIO Centers, as well as by DataONE.

The Project Lead, Dr. Tracy Teal, was supported by [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org) at Michigan State University.
