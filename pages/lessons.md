Based on the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) strategy of collaborative development
of hands-on, interactive lessons for workshops, we facilitate and
develop the lessons for Data Carpentry workshops.

[Interested in helping develop lessons?](/involved-lessons/)

These lessons are distributed under the [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) and are free for re-use or adaptation, with attribution. We've had people use the lessons in courses, to build new lessons or use them for self-guided learning.

**Current workshops are designed for researchers with little to
no prior computational experience.**


## Established Lessons
*Lesson formatting is currently being updated*

We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model
the data management and analysis workflow.

## Lessons Under Development


### Genomics Workshop
These workshop materials are focused on working with genomics data.

[Overview of the genomics workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/)

- [Introduction to the workshop and dataset](http://www.datacarpentry.org/introduction-genomics/)
- [Know your data](https://github.com/datacarpentry/knowyourdata-genomics/tree/gh-pages/lessons)
- [Introduction to the command line](https://github.com/datacarpentry/shell-genomics/blob/gh-pages/README.md)
- [Introduction to cloud computing](https://github.com/datacarpentry/cloud-genomics/tree/master/lessons)
- [Data analysis in R](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/04-dplyr.html)
- [Data visualization in R](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/05-data-visualization.html)

### Semester-long Biology Course

[These materials](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/) are being used in a course at the
Univeristy of Florida in Fall 2015. It is not currently meant to be fully comprehensible without additional
context.
