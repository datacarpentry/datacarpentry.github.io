A Partner is an organization that has made a commitment to the growth and spread
of Data Carpentry. Partners receive annual access to instructor training and guidance with capacity building at their organization. Partners are able to run low-cost local workshops while developing communities of practice around effective data-driven reproducible research. Community developed lessons enable our instructors to globally share the effort for developing impactful lessons on technical topics. Partnerships give Software and Data Carpentry revenue to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the lessons demanded by research communities. We work to give your local instructors support, mentorship and a forum for community lesson development.

**If you are already a Software Carpentry Foundation Partner or Affiliate** you are also considered a Data Carpentry Partner under the same terms through the end of your contract. 

We offer several levels of Partnerships, based on training activities expected annually.

#### Notes

\* For [Coordinated workshops](/workshops-host/), we will find instructors for the workshop, set up and handle registration, support instructor logistics and coordinate and share assessment results with the Partner organization. A designated contact approves coordinated workshop requests for that organization. Instructor travel expenses are the responsibility of the partner and are not covered in Partnership fees.

\*\* For [Self-organized workshops](/self-organized-workshops/) the organization is responsible for finding local instructors and handling the logistics of the workshop coordination, including registration and registering the workshop with Software and Data Carpentry. As long at least one instructor is certified and the Software or Data Carpentry content is taught, it can be labeled a Carpentry workshop.

\*\*\* Any instructor training includes the instructor mentorship and support of the instructors through the instructor development program.

^ in-person instructor trainings require an available trainer and travel funds to support instructor trainer(s) travel.

We are always interested in developing new partnerships, and in participating in grants and other proposals. To reach us, or to find out more, [please send us email](mailto:partnerships@datacarpentry.org)
