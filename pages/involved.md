Data Carpentry is primarily a volunteer organization. We work with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) to train instructors, and all content is developed collaboratively
by volunteers. We also have volunteer helpers at workshops and can use help on infrastructure
such as the web site or workshop coordination.

### Become a Partner!

A Partner is an organization that has made a commitment to the growth and spread of Data Carpentry. Partners receive annual access to instructor training and guidance with capacity building at their organization. Partners are able to run low-cost local workshops while developing communities of practice around effective data-driven reproducible research.
