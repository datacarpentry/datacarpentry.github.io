Most of our workshops our hosted at individual institutions or departments,
and people from those departments receive priority.

If you are interested in attending a workshop, keep an eye on our our [Upcoming workshops](/workshops-upcoming/) page, or look in to ways to get someone to [Host](/workshops-host/) 
a workshop at your organization. 

We are also working on developing strategies to deliver workshops outside of individual
institutions. More information soon! 

### What to expect if you're attending a workshop

- Workshops are hands-on. Plan to bring your laptop and be prepared to work along!
- We use a [Code of Conduct](http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/) and instructors and participants are required to follow this code to 
ensure a friendly learning environment for all partipants. 
- Workshops are typically two full days of focused instruction. Individual modules last 1.5
to 3 hours and are separated by breaks or lunch. 
- All workshop materials are free and public and will be available before, during and after 
the workshop.
- You will be taught by a trained Software/Data Carpentry instructor. All our instructors
are volunteers committed to training others in these skills and approaches. They have 
appropriate skills and knowledge and have been through a Train the Trainers program.
- Before the workshop, we will send out instructions on what you need to have installed or
set up on your computer, what tutorials will be used and a pre-workshop survey to complete for 
us to get the best information on who will be attending. 
- After the workshop, we welcome feedback and in particular appreciate your completion of 
the post-workshop survey to continue to improve the workshop materials and experience.
