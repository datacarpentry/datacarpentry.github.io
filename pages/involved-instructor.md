Data Carpentry workshops are taught by trained, peer, volunteer instructors. We
work with the [Software Carpentry Foundation](http://software-carpentry.org) to develop and deliver an Instructors Training program. This program teaches instructional pedagogy as
well as the practicalities of teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop.

Instructors teach workshops in their local area or have the opportunity to travel to
teach. We teach workshops around the world! Once you're an instructor, we'll match you with teaching opportunities that fit your
schedule, travel interests and availability.

### How to become an instructor

_If you are already a Software Carpentry instructor, see information on the [FastTrack](#data-carpentry-fasttrack-instructors-application) program below._

The Software Carpentry Foundation runs the Instructor Training course for both Software and Data Carpentry.

There are two steps to becoming an instructor.  

1. **Take a Software Carpentry Foundation instructor training course**   
This course teaches the pedagogy of instructing and provides hands-on opportunities to practice teaching.  
[http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/)   
 The SCF is finalizing its plans for 2016, so more information on training opportunities will be available soon.

2. **Complete the Data Carpentry specific training**
    - Complete a guided teaching practice for one Data Carpentry lesson
    - [Submit a new exercise](/instructor-checkout-exercises/) and pass a 5 minute teaching practicum for that lesson

### Data Carpentry FastTrack Instructors Application

There are currently
Software Carpentry instructors interested in being Data Carpentry instructors
and trained educators interested in teaching workshops. If you are interested in teaching people new to computation and data analysis,
have the skills to teach
introductory R, Python or SQL and demonstrated teaching experience as a Software
Carpentry instructor or in another capacity, we would love to have you as an instructor!

If you want to also be a Data Carpentry instructor, you can go through the Fast Track program. If you missed the November opportunity, you can still apply and go through instructor onboarding. 


- See more information in this blog post: [http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/fasttrack/](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/fasttrack/)  
- Fill out the FastTrack application:

- Sign up for an upcoming onboarding meeting on [http://pad.software-carpentry.org/data-carpentry-instructors](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/data-carpentry-instructors)  

We are interested in instructors in any domain of research, and are particularly
working to grow our instructor pool in social sciences and digital humanities.
