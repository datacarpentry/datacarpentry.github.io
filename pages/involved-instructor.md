Data Carpentry workshops are taught by trained, peer, volunteer instructors. We
work with the [Software Carpentry Foundation](http://software-carpentry.org) to develop and deliver a
Train the Trainers (T3) program. This program teaches instructional pedagogy as
well as the practicalities of teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop.

Instructors teach workshops in their local area or have the opportunity to travel to
teach. We teach workshops around the world!

Once you're an instructor, we'll match you with teaching opportunities that fit your
schedule and travel interest and availability.


### Data Carpentry 'Fast Track' Instructors Application

There are currently
many Software Carpentry instructors interested in being Data Carpentry instructors
and trained educators interested in teaching workshops. To enable this
transition, we are developing a 'Fast Track' program.

If you are interested in teaching people new to computation and data analysis,
have the skills to teach
introductory R, Python or SQL and demonstrated teaching experience as a Software
Carpentry instructor or in another capacity, we would love to have you as an instructor!

We are interested in instructors in any domain of research, and are particularly
working to grow our instructor pool in social sciences and digital humanities.

We'll have more information on this 'Fast Track' program very soon! Follow this site,
our [blog](/blog/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/datacarpentry) or the discussion on
our [forum](http://discuss.datacarpentry.org/t/how-to-become-a-data-carpentry-instructor/33)



### Information on Train the Trainer events with the Software Carpentry Foundation

We will be working with Software Carpentry to provide both Software and Data
Carpentry train-the-trainer instruction in future T3s.

as it becomes available.
