We are always in the process of developing content for new domains and topics.
If you are interested in participating, please apply for a hackathon,
help develop on line or [get in touch](/contact/).

## Lesson Domains under Development

### Geospatial Data Carpentry

Hackathon to develop lessons for working with Geospatial data, in collaboration
with [NEON](http://neoninc.org) October 21-23, 2015.

[Apply for the hackathon!](http://www.neoninc.org/updates-events/update/got-spatio-temporal-data-analysis-skillz-join-neon%E2%80%99s-data-skills-hackathon)

### Social Sciences Data Carpentry

Many people are involved in establishing a Data Carpentry for Social Sciences.
This will include versions focused on rectangular data, like survey data, and 
text mining. 

A recent hackathon at the [UC Berkeley DLab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu) organized by Dav Clark and Jon Stiles worked to find a data set and determine topics. 
More work on these coming soon! Stay posted at [http://discuss.datacarpentry.org/c/social-science-data-carpentry](http://discuss.datacarpentry.org/c/social-science-data-carpentry).

## Lesson Topics Under Development

### Data visualization 

There is interest in lessons more specificially focused on data visualization,
and we're establishing a group of interested people.

### Working with APIs

This is a topic where we often have interest. Lessons on this topic are
being piloted.
