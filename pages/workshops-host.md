**Information on how to request and host a Data Carpentry workshop.**

Already know the details? [Request a Workshop!](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/dc/request/)

If you would like a Software Carpentry workshop, please [visit their web site](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request.html).

### Workshop Fees

The cost of hosting a workshop is both the Workshop Administration Fee and
travel expenses for the two instructors.

**Workshop Administration Fee:** $2500 US
Partial or full waivers for Fees will be considered on a needs basis.

**Travel Expenses for Instructors:** ~$2000 US
All instructors are volunteers, but the Host needs to cover their travel expenses.
We work to find local instructors, but suggest that you estimate about $2000 for
the travel, food and accomodation of the instructors. The details of how you will
reimburse the instructors needs to be established when the workshop is scheduled.

### Process for Requesting and Hosting a Workshop

- Request a workshop through our [Workshop Request Form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/dc/request/)
You will be asked to select a range of dates that will work for your workshop and for
information about the target audience, so we know which [workshop curriculum](/workshops-offered) will be best for you.

- We will find Instructors for your workshop and then work with you to set a final date
and workshop type for your workshop.

- We'll set up a workshop web site and your registration if requested.
It is up to the Host to decide if they will charge each participant. Often a nominal
fee of $20 reduces the number of no-shows. Since most workshops have a wait list, it
is best to be able to offer these spots to people on the wait list instead of having
an empty seat.

- The Lead Instructor will then be your point of contact to coordinate details and
communicate with workshop participants, communicating with Data Carpentry administration
as needed.

- The Host is reponsible for local coordination, such as booking a room, ensuring there
is power in the room and arranging things like coffee.

- The Host and Instructors will work together to book travel in advance of the workshop.
Please treat the Instructors as you would a visiting speaker. They won't know the
location, so helping them with things like finding a hotel and information on transportation
from the airport is greatly appreciated!
