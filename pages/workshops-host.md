**Information on how to request and host a Data Carpentry workshop.**


Already know the details? [Request a Workshop!](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/dc/request/)  

### Process for Requesting and Hosting a Workshop

- Request a workshop through our [Workshop Request Form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/dc/request/). You will be asked to select a range of dates that will work for your workshop and for
information about the target audience, so we know which [workshop curriculum](/workshops-offered) will be best for you.

- We will find Instructors for your workshop and then work with you to set a final date
and curriculum for your workshop.

- We'll set up a workshop web site and your registration form if requested. It is up to the Host to decide 
if they will charge each participant. Often a nominal
fee of $20 reduces the number of no-shows. Since most workshops have a wait list, it
is best to be able to offer these spots to people on the wait list instead of having
an empty seat. 

- The Lead Instructor will then be your point of contact to coordinate details and 
communicate with workshop participants, communicating with Data Carpentry administration
as needed. 

- The Host is reponsible for local coordination, such as booking a room, ensuring there
is power in the room and arranging things like coffee. 

- The Host and Instructors will work together to book travel in advance of the workshop. Please treat the 
instructors as you would a visiting speaker. They won't know the location, so helping them with things like finding a hotel and information on transportation from the airport is greatly appreciated!

Data Carpentry administration will take care of all non-local logistical details. You can see a list of what we take care of [here](/admin/). If you have special needs for any of these pieces of the workshop, please contact the [Data Carpentry workshop coordinator](mailto:admin@datacarpentry.org) (admin@datacarpentry.org).

### Workshop Fees

The cost of hosting a workshop is both the Workshop Administration Fee and
travel expenses for the two instructors. 



**Workshop Administration Fee:** $2500 US  
*This is the fee for not-for-profit organizations, such as universities and
government labs. The fee for for-profit organizations is $10000 US. For more information about workshop fees for for-profit organizations please [contact us](mailto:tkteal@datacarpentry.org).  

Partial or full waivers for fees will be considered on an as-needed basis.

**Travel Expenses for Instructors:** ~$2000 US  
All instructors are volunteers, but the Host needs to cover their travel expenses.
We work to find local instructors, but suggest that you estimate about $2000 for 
the travel, food and accomodation of the instructors. The details of how you will 
reimburse the instructors needs to be established when the workshop is scheduled. 

50% of workshop coordination fees for for-profit organizations go towards supporting workshops in areas with financial need.*
