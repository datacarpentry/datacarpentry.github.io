We are always in the process of developing content for new domains and topics.
If you are interested in participating, please apply for a hackathon,
help develop on line, [get in touch](/contact/) or see our [lessons under
development](/workshops-development/).

All of our lessons are collaboratively developed and distributed under the
[CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license. We welcome
contributions!

Fix a typo, suggest a new module or add features to topics. We have a
[discussion forum](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/) and a [Slack organization](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) for discussion of
topics or teaching strategies. If comments or suggestions are directly
related to lesson content, please also feel free to file a github issue.
