## Library Carpentry Coordinator Position

The Carpentries is a non-profit volunteer organization with a mission of building community and teaching data literacy. We empower people to effectively use computational and data skills in their work through accessible and inclusive short, impactful workshops and train instructors in educational pedagogy to teach these skills. 

Library Carpentry leverages the success of the Carpentries pedagogy, which is based on providing a goal-oriented, hands-on, trial-and-error approach to learning computational skills, and extends it to meet the specific needs of librarians. In Library Carpentry, we identify the fundamental skills needed for librarians and develop and teach these skills in hands-on, interactive workshops. Workshops are designed for people with little to no prior computational experience, and they work with data relevant to librarians (so that librarians are working with data most applicable to their own work). Workshops are also friendly learning environments with the sole aim of empowering people to use computational skills effectively and with more confidence.

The Carpentries (a joint project of Software and Data Carpentry) is looking to hire a Library Carpentry Coordinator to further develop Library Carpentry and continue to build a community and curriculum. A successful Library Carpentry Coordinator is passionate about bringing data skills and perspectives to the library community and supporting libraries in building local capacity for training. The Library Carpentry Coordinator (2 year contract) will use product management skills, project management skills, software/data skills, and knowledge of the Data Carpentry & Software Carpentry community to promote and expand the reach of the Library Carpentry across the US. Applications are open, and the position will remain open until filled.
