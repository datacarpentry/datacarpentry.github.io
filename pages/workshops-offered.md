Our workshops are designed to teach the fundamental data skills 
for researchers to make effective and efficient progress in their 
own research. This means matching the skills required with domain
and learning stage.

**Current workshops are designed for researchers with little to 
no prior computational experience.**

We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model
the data management and analysis workflow. There are workshop flavors
for each domain and dataset, and those can be selected when a 
workshop is requested. While we are developing new lessons, we cannot
offer any custom content at this time. 

If you are interested in other lessons, please see information about 
our lessons under development: [/workshops-development/]. Lessons in social science, library science and
geospatial data are being developed.

## Biology Workshops

### Biological Data and R  
This workshop uses survey data of small mammals, and goes from 
initial data organization in spreadsheets and project setup to 
data management in SQL and data analysis and visualization in R.

**Curriculum**  

- Data organization in spreadsheets
- Data cleaning with OpenRefine
- Data management with SQL
- Data analysis and visualization in R


### Biological Data and Python
This workshop uses survey data of small mammals, and goes from 
initial data organization in spreadsheets and project setup to 
data management in SQL and data analysis and visualization in Python.

**Curriculum**  

* Data organization in spreadsheets
* Data cleaning with OpenRefine
* Data management with SQL

## Genomics Workshop
This workshop is focused on working with genomics data. It starts
with project organization, goes through an introduction to the command
line, using cloud computing for bioinformatics pipelines and an introduction
to data analysis and visualization in R.
